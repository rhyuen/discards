            The hope is that the half-million drone-planted seedlings will help the scorched forest rebound more quickly
            than it could on its own. “If it’s a kilometer to the nearest living tree, it’s going to be a long time
            before seed can get there, and so that’s where humans can step in, including with drone technology, to just
            accelerate the recovery and long-term development of the area,” says John Bailey, a professor at Oregon
            State University’s College of Forestry.

            Drones take a different approach. For the pilot program, Guichon’s group and the government reporting entity
            Forest Enhancement Society of British Columbia purchased fir and pine seeds from a nursery in California and
            sent them to DroneSeed, a Seattle-based agrotech startup. “They put the seeds in the small vessel, the puck,
            which contains a mix of soil and nutrients to give the seeds the best chance at germination,” Guichon says.

        <p>
            Bailey says there are key things to take into consideration when using drones to reseed forests. Some areas
            in particular might not be hospitable to the seeded pucks. “Lower elevation, lower latitudes, south-facing,
            steep slopes: they can get very hot, as well, and if you’ve lost all or most of the canopy cover to mediate
            the heat, that can be a really harsh environment, even for a seedling that you plant in the ground, much
            less a new seed germinating,” Bailey says.

            Trees can normally regenerate due to the scatterings of pine cones by the wind or with the help of animals.
            But when a fire burns too hot, there is no way for seeds to survive and trees to grow back naturally in
            charred soils. To help forests rebuild, communities are turning to technological alternatives — including
            drones.

            2017 was one of the worst fire seasons on record in British Columbia. Nearly 800,000 hectares went up in
            smoke, taking with them homes, cars, and trees. For the local residents and First Nations communities in the
            area, it was devastating. During that season, 20 different fires merged to form the Plateau Complex. (At the
            time, it was the largest recorded fire in the province’s history.) While forest fires are a naturally
            occurring hazard that have been happening for millennia, climate change and human activity have increased
            the prevalence of wildfires in recent decades, in addition to exacerbating how severely they scorch.
        </p>
        <p>
            “A lot of these areas where there have been wildfires, some of these areas have burnt so hot that there’s no
            regeneration of seedlings,” Percy Guichon says. Guichon is the director of the Central Chilcotin
            Rehabilitation, a reforestation and land management company in British Columbia. He is from the Tŝideldel
            First Nation community that works in conjunction with the Tl’etinqox First Nations Government to reseed the
            forests where the Plateau Complex fire burned. Both are local communities that were affected by the
            devastating fires.

        <p>Why? Just to practice using Grid. There was an article by Josh Comeau that demonstrated how to do something
            similar and it has been a while since I had practiced it. Also, the design keeps popping up on sites like
            TheVerge and The Guardian.</p>
