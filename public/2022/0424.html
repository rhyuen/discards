            Update, Jan. 31, 2022: In late January, as part of a sweeping announcement detailing strategies to crack
            down on toxic industrial air pollution, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promised to keep
            communities “informed and engaged” as it works to address
            toxic ethylene oxide pollution across the country.
            The agency also said it was moving to formally reject Texas’ less protective standard for the chemical.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph--first-letter">
            Jennifer Jinot didn’t expect to retire early from her role as an environmental health scientist for the
            federal government. She’d spent 26 years assessing the dangers of toxic chemicals for the U.S. Environmental
            Protection Agency. The job could be frustrating but, more than that, rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Early in her career, Jinot evaluated the health impacts of secondhand smoke exposure. It took four years — a
            pace she remembers thinking was “crazy slow” — to develop a final risk assessment, published in 1993, that
            determined secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in adults and impairs the respiratory systems of children.
            The tobacco industry sued the agency. But, in the end, her work spurred changes to the law. The victory was
            invigorating for Jinot, who had long dreamed of doing what she calls “socially useful” science.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2002, Jinot joined an EPA team that was evaluating new research to determine whether ethylene oxide, one
            of the world’s most widely used chemicals, caused cancer. A key building block for an endless array of
            consumer goods and a common product used for sterilizing medical equipment, the colorless, low-odor gas
            wafts out of at least 160 facilities across America. Jinot’s colleagues had already spent four years reading
            studies, scrutinizing data and consulting with experts. She was hopeful it wouldn’t take much longer. The
            team published a draft assessment in 2006 that found the chemical was significantly more carcinogenic than
            the agency had previously concluded and especially damaging to children.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jinot believed the science begged for urgent action to strengthen existing environmental regulations. But
            industry lobbyists and company executives attacked the draft. Audry E. Eldridge, then-president of the
            Missouri-based Midwest Sterilization Corporation, argued in a 2006 letter that an “extensive database of
            toxicological and epidemiological studies” showed the EPA’s findings were flawed. Eldridge, who helped found
            the Ethylene Oxide Sterilization Association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of sterilizer companies,
            didn’t name any specific studies, but said in the letter that the cancer risk posed by the chemical was
            “thousands of times less than portrayed in EPA’s risk estimates.”

        <p class="paragraph--first-letter">
            Amid pressure from industry groups, the agency agreed to another round of scrutiny from independent
            scientists and the public before finalizing its findings. “They don’t want to put out anything that gets
            attacked,” <q class="quote--right">They don’t want to put out anything that gets
                attacked</q>Jinot said of the EPA in a recent interview. The EPA defended its process for evaluating
            harmful
            environmental chemicals as “strong” in a statement to ProPublica and The Texas Tribune.
        </p>
        <p>
            A process that, according to a director for the U.S. Government Accountability Office, should last no more
            than four years ended up taking another decade. In 2016, the EPA published the final version of its
            assessment. It concluded that ethylene oxide was 30 times more carcinogenic to people who continuously
            inhale it as adults and 50 times more carcinogenic to those who are exposed since birth than the agency
            previously thought. The chemical, which alters DNA in the human body and increases the risk of certain types
            of cancer such as leukemia, is particularly harmful to children because their developing bodies can’t mend
            the genetic damage as effectively as adult bodies.

            In the decade it took for the federal agency to finalize what its frustrated scientists already knew,
            Eldridge’s sterilization company dramatically expanded its new facility in the border city of Laredo, Texas.
            The facility, a ProPublica analysis determined, emitted far more ethylene oxide than any other sterilizer
            plant in the country that reports emissions to the EPA.

            Simultaneously, families along its fence line were raising a generation of children who would grow up in the
            plant’s shadow.

            Karla and Cesar Ortiz had a baby girl they named Yaneli, after a Spanish-language television character who
            embodied kindness and humility, traits they hoped their daughter would share. Through the years, their
            smiley, curly-haired little girl grew to love arts and crafts, became a fan of ’80s music and K-pop and
            watched over her two little brothers in their home, located less than 5 miles from Midwest.

            Around the same time, Nidia and Rafael Nevares were raising their two boys, Rafael Jr. and Juan Jose, or JJ,
            about 2 miles from the plant. The younger of the two, JJ was more outgoing and quick to make friends. Among
            his favorite things to do was pulling his older brother away from the computer to play hide-and-seek in the
            front yard.

            The EPA’s 2016 ethylene oxide report would not be legally enforceable until the agency incorporated it into
            new regulations. <q class="quote--left">The EPA’s 2016 ethylene oxide report would not be legally
                enforceable until the agency incorporated it into
                new regulations.</q> Even so, it inspired many states to crack down on industrial facilities that
            emitted the
            chemical — through lawsuits, stricter state regulations, air monitoring and cancer cluster studies. But
            Texas went in the other direction, becoming the only state to officially reject the agency’s conclusions. In
            August 2017, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the state’s environmental regulatory agency,
            announced it would launch a review of EPA’s science; it eventually ruled that the chemical was significantly
            less toxic than the federal agency had found. That resulted in Texas enacting a new standard that could
            allow plants to emit more of the chemical.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018, two years after the EPA published its final report, JJ was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic
            leukemia, a cancer that has been linked to ethylene oxide exposure. He turned 6 years old a month later.
