        <h1>The disinformation playbook: how industry manipulates the science-policy process—and how to restore
            scientific integrity</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            For decades, corporate undermining of scientific consensus has eroded the scientific process worldwide.
            Guardrails for protecting science-informed processes, from peer review to regulatory decision making, have
            suffered sustained attacks, damaging public trust in the scientific enterprise and its aim to serve the
            public good. Government efforts to address corporate attacks have been inadequate. Researchers have
            cataloged corporate malfeasance that harms people’s health across diverse industries. Well-known cases, like
            the tobacco industry’s efforts to downplay the dangers of smoking, are representative of transnational
            industries, rather than unique. This contribution schematizes industry tactics to distort, delay, or
            distract the public from instituting measures that improve health—tactics that comprise the “disinformation
            playbook.” Using a United States policy lens, we outline steps the scientific community should take to
            shield science from corporate interference, through individual actions (by scientists, peer reviewers, and
            editors) and collective initiatives (by research institutions, grant organizations, professional
            associations, and regulatory agencies).
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Science shapes our understanding of, and efforts to improve, people’s health, and well-being. If these
            efforts threaten an industry’s commercial interests, however, the industry worldwide may attempt to suppress
            or undermine the underlying science. Researchers have long chronicled the infamous example of the tobacco
            industry [1]. For decades, tobacco companies minimized the dangers of smoking, falsely presented low-tar and
            filtered cigarettes as safer, and denied the science demonstrating the hazards of secondhand smoke [1–3].
            The success of the “tobacco playbook” made it a template for others, including the lead [4], sugar [5], and
            oil and gas industries [6].
        </p>
        <p>
            While industry can target every step in the policymaking process, science—on which health-based government
            decisions depend—is especially vulnerable [3]. Science relies on constructive critique to spur research,
            ensure rigorous results, and test hypotheses. By reframing this procedural scrutiny as “doubt,” industry can
            undermine commercially inconvenient science. For industry, this means that debating the science is a
            shortcut to debating policy, making attacks on science a powerful tactic to shape regulation and insulate
            against litigation [2]. Understanding the disinformation playbook can help public health professionals,
            policymakers, and the public recognize and resist corporate interference in science.
        </p>
        <p>
            As science has become increasingly politicized, it is more important than ever to analyze how scientific
            knowledge leads to public health policies that protect populations. The industry disinformation playbook
            enables corporate actors to undermine health-protective public policy, instead bending science to fit
            political ideologies at the expense of public health. This analysis presents case studies that illustrate
            this playbook’s dangers and offers policy mechanisms that can help prevent similar cases of corrupted
            science in the future. While this analysis focuses primarily on the United States, the problems and
            solutions described are applicable elsewhere, experienced especially in other high-income countries. As
            Europe and the US often serve as policy benchmarks for other countries, it is doubly important that rich
            democratic countries set a positive precedent for dealing with the runaway power of industry and its efforts
            to deprioritize public health.
        </p>

        <h2>Disinformation playbook tactics</h2>
        <p>
            While there are many tactics used by industry to obscure science [7], we focus on five tactics that most
            directly affect the science-policy interface (Fig. 1). Some “plays” occur internally—companies may conduct
            biased studies, use or publicize only favorable results, suppress unfavorable results, and retaliate against
            scientists. Others involve external stakeholders, such as government scientists and elected officials.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Faking science: conducting—or paying others to conduct—flawed or biased scientific studies, or hiding
            research with unfavorable conclusions

        </h2>
        <p>
            Industry-sponsored research is more likely to have favorable outcomes for the target product or process than
            research funded by other sources, a phenomenon known as the “funding effect” [8]. Companies can:

            Publish studies with flawed methodologies (such as overlooking cumulative exposure), or bury studies with
            unfavorable results;
            Fund university scientists with explicit or implicit strings attached (for example, reserving the right to
            edit results);
            Hire firms from the “product defense industry” to deliver studies skewing the science in favor of a
            company’s agenda [2];
            Hide conflicts of interest for industry-funded or -affiliated scientists who publish papers, give testimony,
            or comment publicly;
            Publish ghostwritten articles in journals or media outlets; or
            Interfere with studies during the prepublication process, including peer review.
            An example of “faking the science” was borne out by the company Johnson & Johnson (J&J). Company officials
            knew as early as 1971 that its talcum baby powder was contaminated with tremolite, an asbestos fiber and
            known carcinogen. They knew the levels at which tremolite could be detected and, as evidenced by internal
            documents, chose not to issue a testing method with better sensitivity and actively fought scientist and
            regulator attempts to do so. J&J’s failure to report at least 12 independent tests conducted over a 15-year
            period that found asbestos in its product meant that the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration
            (FDA) did not have adequate scientific information to make a regulatory decision. There is evidence that, in
            1972, J&J manipulated the findings of one of the tests sent to the FDA by deleting the total tremolite
            content found in its baby powder product. FDA’s susceptibility to industry pressure, coupled with
            insufficient or biased company-submitted data, means that proper scrutiny of these products has been
            delayed. Over 19,000 lawsuits are currently pending against J&J related to harms caused by its powders,
            including ovarian cancer [9]. J&J took the powder off the market in North America in 2020 [10] but still
            affirms its safety.
