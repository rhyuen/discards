            <h1>As Colorado River Dries, the U.S. Teeters on the Brink of Larger Water Crisis</h1>
            <p>The megadrought gripping the western states is only part of the problem. Alternative sources of water are
                also imperiled, and the nation’s food along with it.

        <article>
            <p>The western United States is, famously, in the grips of its worst megadrought in a millennium. The
                Colorado
                River, which supplies water to more than 40 million Americans and supports food production for the rest
                of
                the country, is in imminent peril. The levels in the nation’s largest freshwater reservoir, Lake Mead,
                behind the Hoover Dam and a fulcrum of the Colorado River basin, have dropped to around 25% of capacity.
                The
                Bureau of Reclamation, which governs lakes Mead and Powell and water distribution for the southern end
                of
                the river, has issued an ultimatum: The seven states that draw from the Colorado must find ways to cut
                their
                consumption — by as much as 40% — or the federal government will do it for them. Last week those states
                failed to agree on new conservation measures by deadline. Meanwhile, next door, California, which draws
                from
                the Colorado, faces its own additional crises, with snowpack and water levels in both its reservoirs and
                aquifers all experiencing a steady, historic and climate-driven decline. It’s a national emergency, but
                not
                a surprise, as scientists and leaders have been warning for a generation that warming plus overuse of
                water
                in a fast-growing West would lead those states to run out.</p>

            <p>
                I recently sat down with Jay Famiglietti, the executive director of the Global Institute for Water
                Security at the University of Saskatchewan, to talk about what comes next and what the public still
                doesn’t understand about water scarcity in the United States. Before moving to Canada, Famiglietti was a
                lead researcher at NASA’s water science program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
                California, and a member of the faculty at the University of California, Irvine. He pioneered the use of
                the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites to peer into the earth’s mass and measure changes
                in its underground water supplies. The Colorado River crisis is urgent, Famiglietti said, but the
                hidden, underground water crisis is even worse. We talked about what U.S. leaders either won’t
                acknowledge or don’t understand and about how bad things are about to get.

            <p>
                Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
            </p>
            <p class="speaker">
                Let’s start with the Colorado River because it’s in the news. The federal government has put some
                extraordinary numbers out there, suggesting water users cut between 2 and 4 million acre-feet of water
                usage starting this year — roughly 40% of the entire river’s recent flow. How could that possibly
                happen?
            </p>
            <p class="response">
                It’s going to be really hard. We’re looking at drastically reduced food production and the migration of
                agriculture to other parts of the country and real limits on growth, especially in desert cities like
                Phoenix. My fear is that groundwater will, as usual, be left out of the discussion — groundwater is
                mostly unprotected, and it’s going to be a real shit show.

            <p class="speaker">
                Remind us how that happens. States and farmers cut back on the Colorado River, and California and
                Arizona just start pumping all the water out of their aquifers?
            </p>
            <p class="response">
                Yeah. This started with the drought contingency plan [the 2018 legal agreement among the states on the
                Colorado River]. Arizona had to cut nearly 20% of its Colorado River water. To placate the farmers, the
                deal was that they would have free access to the groundwater. In fact, something like $20 million was
                allocated to help them dig more wells. So, it was just a direct transfer from surface water to
                groundwater. Right away, you could see that the groundwater depletion was accelerating. With this latest
                round, I’m afraid we’re just going to see more of that.
            </p>
            <p class="speaker">
                Some of that groundwater actually gets used to grow feed for cattle in the Middle East or China, right?
                There’s Saudi-owned agriculture firms planting alfalfa, which uses more water than just about anything,
                and it’s not for American food supply. Do I have that right?
            </p>
            
            <p class="response">
                There’s been other buyers from other countries coming in, buying up that land, land grabbing and
                grabbing the water rights. That’s happening in Arizona.
            </p>

            <p class="speaker">
                What about in California? Groundwater depletion has caused the earth to sink in on itself. Parts of the
                Central Valley are 28 feet lower today than they were a century ago.
            </p>
            <p class="response">
                California passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in 2014, which mandated an extraordinarily
                long time horizon: two years to form the Groundwater Sustainability Agencies and then five years for
                each GSA to come up with its sustainability plan. So that’s now: 2022. And then 20 years to come into
                sustainability. My fear is that the slow implementation will allow for too much groundwater depletion to
                happen. It’s sort of the same old, same old.
