        <h1>Vancouver police 'fear-mongering' by highlighting violent crime, expert says</h1>
        <p>
            Data provided by the Vancouver Police Department doesn't support the notion that there has been a
            significant spike in violent crime in the city recently, according to an expert who has been looking at
            trends for the past 25 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Professor Martin Andresen, a criminologist at SFU, says the notion that the city has become less safe has
            been shaped, at least in part, by the communications coming from the Vancouver Police Department (VPD)
            through press releases and social media posts that have emphasized random acts of violence.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The cops, I think they have got a political agenda here. I don't think they're doing the public a proper
            service by doing what they're doing -- they're fear-mongering," he says.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Here's my hypothesis: What's happening is VPD is doing their best right now to literally scare the public
            because they were facing a budget reduction from the City of Vancouver."

        <h2>
            VPD BUDGET DEBATE, DECISION
        </h2>
        <p>
            Last month, the province ordered City Council to reverse a decision not to increase the force's operating
            budget by $5.7 million for 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            Responding to the decision, Chief Adam Palmer said restoring the funding will allow the department to meet
            the city's "complex policing needs" by hiring more officers, referring to increased demands on the
            department in the wake of council making the move in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Since that time, Vancouver has been gripped by an abundance of public safety challenges, including the
            ongoing Lower Mainland gang conflict, a surge in violent street crime, nearly 1,000 protests, concerning
            levels of hate crime, and a growing number of people who tell us they just don’t feel as safe as they used
            to, " Palmer wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
            Asked whether the VPD's communication about violent crime in the city has been in any way shaped by this
            budget decision, spokesperson Sgt. Steve Addison said, "No."
        </p>
        <p>
            He said several factors go into deciding which crimes to publicize by issuing press releases or posting on
            social media. The need to solicit the public's help with an investigation of a crime that has not been
            solved is one. Appeals for witnesses, or distributing sketches or video of suspects are examples of this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alerting the public to crimes that have been solved, even when an arrest was made at the scene is also
            something Addison says is part of the force's job.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The citizens of Vancouver deserve to know what the Vancouver Police Department is doing to keep them safe,
            and to apprehend offenders," he said.
        </p>
        <h2>
            POLICE-PROVIDED DATA ON CRIME
        </h2>
        <p>
            Last week, the Vancouver Police Department published its report on public safety indicators in the city for
            the first quarter of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, reported incidents of violent crime have remained relatively unchanged when compared to the same
            time last year, and are down from the same time in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the report to the board also compares this year's numbers to the three-year average from 2017 to
            2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            "These numbers show that many serious crimes are on the rise, compared to pre-pandemic levels," the
            department said in a tweet accompanied by an image showing percentage increases and decreases for some types
            of crime.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Andresen says when looking at these reports, it's important to look beyond percentages and focus on the
            actual numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Are these changes really changing risk?" he asks
        </p>
        <p>
            In Q1 2022, there was a 0.8 per cent decrease in police-reported violent crime compared to the same time
            last year. That works out to 11 fewer incidents. Compared to 2020, the number is down to 1,397 from 1,451 –
            a decrease of 54 incidents, or 3.7 per cent. Using that figure as a basis for comparison, the report shows
            an increase of 147 incidents, or 12 per cent.
            This increase translates into an average of 1.6 more reports per day. All crimes are bad, especially violent
            crimes. Nobody wants to be a victim of violent crime, I don't want to
            minimize that," Andresen says. "There aren't that many of these crimes when you consider the grand scheme of
            what police end up working with. He points out that, over all, violent crime makes up just a small fraction
            of what police are called
            to respond to, and says the most violent crimes make up a mere fraction of calls for service.
        </p>
        <h2>OVERALL CALLS FOR SERVICE DOWN</h2>
        <p>
            The department says, in its report, that calls for service include 911 reports, calls to the non-emergency
            line and online crime reporting.

            The VPD received 51,870 calls for service in the first quarter of 2022. Of those 1,397 were reports of
            violent crime, which means those reports comprised about 2.5 per cent of the total.

            The report does not compare the total number of calls for service in Q1 of 2022 with the pre-pandemic time
            period. However, that three-year average from 2017 to 2019 is 61,831. That works out to 9,961 fewer calls
            for service in the first quarter of this year -- or 110 per day on average.
        </p>
        <figure class="content-size">

        </figure>
        <p>
            The VPD's focus on an increase in violent crime, Andresen maintains, can't and shouldn’t be abstracted from
            other public debates and conversations on the role of police, particularly the only recently-resolved matter
            of the budget and the proposition of "defunding the police" by investing money in health, housing, and
            social services.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I think that this is highly political, to basically scare the public into supporting them to increase
            police funding."
        </p>
        <h2>
            POLICE CITE CONCERNING INCREASE IN MOST SERIOUS ASSAULTS
        </h2>
        <p>
            An increase in serious assaults, which includes assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, and
            aggravated assault is something the police have said is a particularly troubling trend.

            "It's a huge concern to the residents and the business community and the police. So that's an area that we
            are concentrating a lot of resources on," Chief Adam Palmer said during February's board meeting, adding the
            data available to the public does not fully capture " the random nature of a lot of the assaults and also
            the violent shoplifting."

            While 2022 shows a five per cent decrease in these crimes from 2021, and a 3.2 per cent decrease from 2020
            the number of reports when compared to the three-year pre-pandemic timeframe is up 36.1 per cent.

            That works out to an increase of 111 incidents, an average increase of 1.2 per day.
        </p>
        <figure class="content-size">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1650871604168-2e8b22829db8?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1412&q=80"
                alt="A staircase of post-its">
            <figcaption>A staircase of post-its.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Andresen agrees with Palmer that the data does not tell the entire story.

            "Who are these people who are in our communities committing these assaults? Are these people who are not
            getting the social services they need? Are they in mental health crisis? Are they in addiction crisis? Do
            they need these additional social services that aren't being given to them because money is going into the
            police budge instead of the public health budget?" Andresen asks.

            Information about both victims and perpetrators is not immediately or publicly available – including data
            about how many assaults are perpetrated by strangers.

            Also missing is data about how many of these violent assaults were instances of domestic violence. The
            increase in intimate partner violence has been called the "shadow pandemic," with organizations that work
            with victims in B.C. and beyond reporting a spike in demand for their services amid COVID-19 restrictions.

            That surge was particularly pronounced during the early days of the pandemic. Data from 17 police forces
            across the country show that calls related to domestic disturbances - which could involve anything from a
            verbal quarrel to reports of violence - rose by nearly 12 per cent between March and June of 2020 compared
            to the same four months in 2019, according to a Statistics Canada analysis.
