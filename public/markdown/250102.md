# January 02, 2025

This is the markdown file for January 02 / 2025.

I may  use this as a template for building a markdown based blog using HTML, CSS and JS.

As I don't wish to manually enter the urls to the markdown files, I plan on using precommit hooks that generate a `json` file and having the `index.html` render that.  The individual blog posts will be rendered on demand.

Words enclosed by backticks, the \``\` character are mapped to the `code` html element. [Source](https://html-to-markdown.com/docs/backtick-in-code#:~:text=html%2Dto%2Dmarkdown,-Introduction&text=Any%20markdown%20content%20wrapped%20with,inside%20a%20tag.)
