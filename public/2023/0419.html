                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Since its emergence in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant morbidity and mortality.1
                    While initial public health measures and research focused on understanding transmission, disease
                    severity, prevention interventions, and treatment of acute infection, efforts to better understand
                    the long-term sequelae and wider consequences of COVID-19 are now at the forefront. While acute
                    infection primarily affects the respiratory system, other organ systems may also be involved,
                    leading to various acute and chronic sequelae.2
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among other long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 may
                    be associated with changes in the pathophysiology of diabetes.3,4 Diabetes has already been
                    established as a risk factor associated with more severe COVID-19 respiratory outcomes, and
                    SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with the worsening of preexisting diabetes symptoms.5-8 However,
                    it is not fully known if SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with transient hyperglycemia during
                    active infection or if metabolic alterations persist, associated with increased risk of subsequent
                    diabetes among individuals with infections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Current data on the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and incident diabetes are sparse, and
                    most published studies have been conducted with relatively small samples or have limitations related
                    to participant selection or outcome ascertainment.9-13 Studies conducted to date have mostly
                    identified a small but higher rate of incident diabetes among people with COVID-19 compared with
                    those without COVID-19. To improve the understanding of this association between SARS-CoV-2
                    infection and incident diabetes, we conducted a large-scale, population-based cohort study using
                    population-based registries and data sets with a comprehensive definition of incident diabetes and
                    evaluated the potential association between COVID-19 infection, including severity of infection, and
                    diabetes incidence. Finally, we calculated the population-attributable fraction (PAF) while
                    controlling for potential confounders to estimate the population-level burden associated with
                    SARS-CoV-2 infection.

                <h2>Discussion</h2>
                <p>
                    In this population-based cohort study, we observed a statistically significantly higher risk of
                    incident diabetes among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those without infection
                    overall and specifically among males. We also found higher risk of diabetes among individuals with
                    more severe disease in males and females. These findings suggest that COVID-19 infection may
                    continue to be associated with outcomes in organ systems involved in regulating blood glucose in the
                    postacute phase and so may have contributed to the 3% to 5% of excess incident diabetes cases found
                    in this study. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with a higher
                    burden of diabetes at the population level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our overall results were consistent with several other studies finding higher risk of incident
                    diabetes after of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, the increase in risk was lower in our analysis
                    compared with other studies. Xie et al23 used national databases of the US Department of Veterans
                    Affairs (VA) and reported a higher risk of incident diabetes among 30-day survivors of COVID-19
                    compared with individuals in the control group over a median follow-up of 352 days (HR, 1.40; 95%
                    CI, 1.36-1.44). The VA population in this study comprised predominantly males with a higher median
                    age than the general population, while our study population was demographically diverse across age
                    and sex. Furthermore, compared with the general US population, the VA is underrepresented in Asian
                    and Hispanic or Latino patients and overrepresented in Black and non-Hispanic White populations,
                    while our study population was drawn from the general population. In addition, an increased
                    overweight and obesity prevalence in the US population (23% of individuals with obesity in British
                    Columbia vs 41% in the VA) may also be associated with these differences.24,25
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disregarding the severity of COVID-19, we found that the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection
                    and diabetes risk was significant only for males, which could be attributed to sex-specific immune
                    responses, such as higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody serum concentrations in females compared with
                    males.26 However, by restricting the sample to individuals with a COVID-19 hospitalization and ICU
                    admission, the increase in risk was not only greater for higher-severity groups, but also
                    significant for males and females. Previous studies had mixed results. Similar to our finding,
                    Wander et al27 used US VA data to find that SARS-CoV-2 was associated with higher odds of incident
                    diabetes (mean follow-up, 193 days) among males (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.80-2.12) but not
                    females. However, in contrast to our findings, Wander et al27 observed the same results when they
                    restricted the sample to individuals hospitalized within 30 days after the index date, with an
                    association among males and not females. Use of dissimilar comparison groups may account for the
                    contrasting finding given that Wander et al27 restricted the COVID-19â€“negative group to hospitalized
                    individuals, while we did not. Furthermore, adjustment of different confounders in the 2 studies and
                    population demographic differences (the VA has an older and predominantly male participant
                    population with lower income and socioeconomic status levels) may be associated with the diverse
                    findings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Xie et al23 used the same database and reported a higher hazard of diabetes at 12 months for
                    individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of severity within males (HR, 1.37; 95% CI,
                    1.33-1.41) and females (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.17-1.40). Although Xie et al23 did not stratify by sex
                    when conducting severity-specific analyses, they observed that COVID-19 infection was positively
                    associated with risks and burdens of postacute incident diabetes, with the increase in risk graded
                    by severity of COVID-19. A similar study by Al-Aly et al28 demonstrated a positive diabetes risk
                    gradient across the care setting of acute COVID-19 infection from individuals who were not
                    hospitalized to those who were hospitalized, and risk was highest in patients who were admitted to
                    ICUs. However, the authors did not conduct any sex-specific analysis. Daugherty et al10 conducted a
                    retrospective cohort study among commercially insured adults in the US to investigate the
                    association between subacute SARS-CoV-2 infection and a wide range of clinical sequelae, reporting a
                    higher hazard of incident nonâ€“insulin-dependent diabetes among individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2
                    (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.14-5.38) over a 6-month follow-up. Daugherty et al10 further found that
                    significant excess risk for incident nonâ€“insulin-dependent diabetes after acute COVID-19 did not
                    differ between men and women. The disagreement may be associated with the specificity of the
                    outcome, differences in study populations, or other methodological differences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Differentiating between type of diabetes (insulin dependent and not insulin dependent), COVID-19 was
                    associated only with nonâ€“insulin-dependent disease. However, we may be limited by the small number
                    of insulin-dependent diabetes events in our sample. Regarding this finding, we are not able to draw
                    a conclusive comparison with previous studies given that they classified diabetes as type 1 or type
                    2 based on single International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,
                    Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. Al-Aly et al28 used VA data and found that COVID-19 was associated
                    with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes only. In contrast, a large-scale retrospective study
                    conducted by Qeadan et al29 using Cerner Real-World Data from the US found significantly higher odds
                    of developing new-onset type 1 diabetes in patients with COVID-19 diagnosis (odds ratio, 1.42; 95%
                    CI, 1.38-1.46) compared with those without COVID-19. However, that study included participants
                    without any age-based exclusion, whereas our study population included only adults. Rathmann et al9
                    used a national-level outpatient primary care data set from Germany and reported a higher incidence
                    rate of type 2 diabetes among individuals with COVID-19 compared with the control group (15.8 vs
                    12.3 incidents/1000 person-years) and no association for other forms of diabetes. Similarly,
                    Birabaharan et al30 found a higher risk of type 2 diabetes among people with mild COVID-19 (relative
                    risk, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.46-1.62) and moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (relative risk, 1.46; 95% CI,
                    1.26-1.69) compared with those in control groups with mild and moderate-to-severe influenza,
                    respectively.

                    diabetes is not clearly understood. However, multiple interrelated processes may be responsible. It
                    has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human pancreatic Î² cells expressing
                    angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and induce Î² cell apoptosis, impacting pancreatic insulin
                    levels and secretion.31 This destruction of Î² cells is relevant to type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
                    Furthermore, chronic low-grade inflammation resulting from proinflammatory pathways in sites such as
                    adipose tissue may also play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of type 2 diabetes.4 We
                    excluded any acute events (ie, within 30 days of the index date) to avoid capturing transient
                    hyperglycemia that can result from acute inflammatory response, medication used for treatment
                    (especially glucocorticoids), and stress (eg, cytokine storm).32

                <p>
                    The major strength of our study was the comprehensive population-based capture of SARS-CoV-2
                    infection and integration of these data with population-based registries and health careâ€“use
                    databases used to identify incident diabetes and ascertain potential confounders. In addition to
                    calculating HRs, we have also provided estimates of the population-attributable fraction that have
                    not been presented before, to our knowledge. Additionally, compared with most previous studies, we
                    had a longer follow-up time, enabling us to investigate the hazard of diabetes as a long-term
                    sequela of COVID-19.

                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <p>Certain limitations of the study are as follows: Although we matched and adjusted for potential
                    confounders, we cannot rule out residual confounding or that, due to a lack of information, some
                    covariates could have affected the association between COVID-19 and incident diabetes; these may
                    include obesity status and physical activity level. We cannot completely rule out surveillance bias
                    given that individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 may have been more likely to receive increased
                    screening or testing compared with those in the COVID-19â€“negative comparison group. Similarly,
                    although we attempted to account for health care access and use by adjusting for material
                    deprivation index score, it is difficult to fully account for differential health care system use.
                    Additionally, it is possible that some participants we classified as unexposed may have contracted
                    COVID-19 before or after entering the study but were not tested or had false-negative results.

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>
                    This large, population-based cohort study was conducted with robust methods addressing limitations
                    of previous studies that had limited generalizability (eg, using specific population groups, such as
                    hospitalized individuals, commercially insured individuals, and veterans, who are predominantly
                    male). We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a higher risk of incident diabetes
                    overall and among males and that severe disease was associated with a higher risk of diabetes among
                    males and females. These results suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may have contributed to a 3%
                    to 5% excess burden of diabetes, which may be associated with a substantial number of diabetes cases
                    with bearing on health care needs for the management of diabetes and its complications. Our study
                    highlights the importance of health agencies and clinicians being aware of the potential long-term
                    consequences of COVID-19 and monitoring people after COVID-19 infection for new-onset diabetes for
                    timely diagnosis and treatment.
