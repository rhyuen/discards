            <span class="first-letter">A</span>s 2021 drew to a close, the highly contagious Omicron variant of the
            pandemic virus was racing around the
            globe, forcing governments to take drastic actions once again. The Netherlands ordered most businesses to
            close on 19 December, Ireland set curfews and many countries imposed travel bans in the hope of taming the
            tsunami of COVID-19 cases filling hospitals. Amid the wave of desperate news around the year-end holidays,
            one group of researchers hailed a development that had seemed as though it might never arrive. On 23
            December, the World Health Organization (WHO) uttered the one word it had previously seemed incapable of
            applying to the virus SARS-CoV-2: ‘airborne’.
        </p>
        <p>
            On its website, a page titled ‘Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): How is it transmitted?’ <q
                class="align-left">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): How is it transmitted?</q>was quietly edited to
            state that a person can be infected “when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at
            short range”, a process otherwise known as “short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission”. The
            website says that transmission can occur through “long-range airborne transmission” in poorly ventilated or
            crowded indoor settings “because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than
            conversational distance”.
        </p>
        <p>

            “It was a relief to see them finally use the word ‘airborne’, and to say clearly that airborne transmission
            and aerosol transmission are synonyms,” <q class="align-right">
                It was a relief to see them finally use the word ‘airborne’, and to say clearly that airborne
                transmission
                and aerosol transmission are synonyms,
            </q>says aerosol chemist Jose-Luis Jimenez at the University of Colorado
            Boulder.
        </p>
        <p>
            The seemingly uncontroversial statement marked a clear shift for the Switzerland-based WHO, which had
            tweeted categorically early in the pandemic, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” casting the negative in
            capital letters as if to remove any doubt. At that time, the agency maintained that the virus spreads mainly
            through droplets produced when a person coughs, sneezes or speaks, an assumption based on decades-old
            infection-control teachings about how respiratory viruses generally pass from one person to another. The
            guidance recommended distancing of more than one metre — within which these droplets were thought to fall to
            the ground — along with hand washing and surface disinfection to stop transfer of droplets to the eyes, nose
            and mouth.

        <p class="first-letter-second">
            It took until 20 October 2020 for the agency to acknowledge that aerosols — tiny specks of fluid — can
            transmit the virus, but the WHO said this was a concern only in specific settings, such as indoor, crowded
            and inadequately ventilated spaces. Over the next six months, the agency gradually altered its advice to say
            that aerosols could carry the virus for more than a metre and remain in the air (see ‘Changing views of how
            COVID spreads’).
        </p>
        <p class="first-letter-second">
            But this latest tweak is the WHO’s clearest statement yet about airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. And it
            places the virus among a select group of ‘airborne’ infections, a label long reserved for just a handful of
            the world’s most virulent pathogens, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis.
        </p>
        <p>
            The change brings the WHO’s messaging in line with what a chorus of aerosol and public-health experts have
            been trying to get it to say since the earliest days of the outbreak. Many decry the agency’s slowness in
            stating — unambiguously — that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne. Interviews conducted by Nature with dozens of
            specialists on disease transmission suggest that the WHO’s reluctance to accept and communicate evidence for
            airborne transmission was based on a series of problematic assumptions about how respiratory viruses spread.
        </p>
        <p class="first-letter-second">
            For example, even in the middle of the fast-moving epidemic, the WHO dismissed field epidemiology reports as
            proof of airborne transmission because the evidence was not definitive, something that is difficult to
            achieve quickly during an outbreak. Other criticisms are that the WHO relies on a narrow band of experts,
            many of whom haven’t studied airborne transmission, and that it eschews a precautionary approach that could
            have protected countless people in the early stages of the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Critics say that inaction at the agency led to national and local health agencies around the world being
            similarly sluggish in addressing the airborne threat. Having shifted its position incrementally over the
            past two years, the WHO also failed to adequately communicate its changing position, they say. As a result,
            it didn’t emphasize early enough and clearly enough the importance of ventilation and indoor masking, key
            measures that can prevent airborne spread of the virus. Lidia Morawska, an aerosol scientist at the
            Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, spearheaded several efforts to convince the WHO
            and other health agencies of the airborne threat. She says that airborne transmission was “so obvious” as
            far back as February 2020, and that omitting it from official guidelines was disastrous.
