                    <h1>Freezing Order</h1>
                    <p>A True Story of Money Laundering, Murder, and Surviving Vladimir Putin's Wrath</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Following his explosive New York Times bestseller Red Notice, Bill Browder returns with another
                        gripping thriller chronicling how he became Vladimir Putin’s number one enemy by exposing
                        Putin’s
                        campaign to steal and launder hundreds of billions of dollars and kill anyone who stands in his
                        way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Bill Browder’s young Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, was beaten to death in a Moscow
                        jail,
                        Browder made it his life’s mission to go after his killers and make sure they faced justice. The
                        first step of that mission was to uncover who was behind the $230 million tax refund scheme that
                        Magnitsky was killed over. As Browder and his team tracked the money as it flowed out of Russia
                        through the Baltics and Cyprus and on to Western Europe and the Americas, they were shocked to
                        discover that Vladimir Putin himself was a beneficiary of the crime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As law enforcement agencies began freezing the money, Putin retaliated. He and his cronies set
                        up
                        honey traps, hired process servers to chase Browder through cities, murdered more of his Russian
                        allies, and enlisted some of the top lawyers and politicians in America to bring him down. Putin
                        will stop at nothing to protect his money. As Freezing Order reveals, it was Browder’s campaign
                        to
                        expose Putin’s corruption that prompted Russia’s intervention in the 2016 US presidential
                        election.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At once a financial caper, an international adventure, and a passionate plea for justice,
                        Freezing
                        Order is a stirring morality tale about how one man can take on one of the most ruthless
                        villains in
                        the world—and win.

                    <h1>The Power of Crisis:</h1>
                    <p>How Three Threats – and Our Response – Will Change the World</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Renowned political scientist Ian Bremmer draws lessons from global challenges of the past 100
                        years—including the pandemic—to show how we can respond to three great crises unfolding over the
                        next decade.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        In this revelatory, unnerving, and ultimately hopeful book, Bremmer details how domestic and
                        international conflicts leave us unprepared for a trio of looming crises—global health
                        emergencies, transformative climate change, and the AI revolution. Today, Americans cannot reach
                        consensus on any significant political issue, and US and Chinese leaders behave as if they’re
                        locked in a new Cold War. We are squandering opportunities to meet the challenges that will soon
                        confront us all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In coming years, humanity will face viruses deadlier and more infectious than Covid.
                        Intensifying climate change will put tens of millions of refugees in flight and require us to
                        reimagine how we live our daily lives. Most dangerous of all, new technologies will reshape the
                        geopolitical order, disrupting our livelihoods and destabilizing our societies faster than we
                        can grasp and address their implications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The good news? Some farsighted political leaders, business decision-makers, and individual
                        citizens are already collaborating to tackle all these crises. The question that should keep us
                        awake is whether they will work well and quickly enough to limit the fallout—and, most
                        importantly, whether we can use these crises to innovate our way toward a better world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Drawing on strategies both time-honored and cutting-edge, from the Marshall Plan to the Green
                        New Deal, The Power of Crisis provides a roadmap for surviving—even thriving in—the 21st
                        century. Bremmer shows governments, corporations, and every concerned citizen how we can use
                        these coming crises to create the worldwide prosperity and opportunity that 20th-century
                        globalism promised but failed to deliver.

                        At first, Logan Ramsay isn’t sure if anything’s different. He just feels a little . . . sharper.
                        Better able to concentrate. Better at multitasking. Reading a bit faster, memorizing better,
                        needing less sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But before long, he can’t deny it: Something’s happening to his brain. To his body. He’s
                        starting to see the world, and those around him—even those he loves most—in whole new ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The truth is, Logan’s genome has been hacked. And there’s a reason he’s been targeted for this
                        upgrade. A reason that goes back decades to the darkest part of his past, and a horrific family
                        legacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Worse still, what’s happening to him is just the first step in a much larger plan, one that will
                        inflict the same changes on humanity at large—at a terrifying cost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of his new abilities, Logan’s the one person in the world capable of stopping what’s
                        been set in motion. But to have a chance at winning this war, he’ll have to become something
                        other than himself. Maybe even something other than human.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And even as he’s fighting, he can’t help wondering: what if humanity’s only hope for a future
                        really does lie in engineering our own evolution?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Intimate in scale yet epic in scope, Upgrade is an intricately plotted, lightning-fast tale that
                        charts one man’s thrilling transformation, even as it asks us to ponder the limits of our
                        humanity—and our boundless potential.
