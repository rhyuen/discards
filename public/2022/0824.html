                <h1>Jamaican migrant workers in Ontario pen open letter likening conditions to 'systematic slavery'</h1>

            <p>
                Jamaican migrant farm workers in Niagara Region wrote an open letter to Jamaica's Ministry of Labour
                requesting more support in the face of what they call "systematic slavery," days before a migrant worker
                died in Norfolk County.
            </p>
            <p>Garvin Yapp, 57, of St. James, Jamaica, was killed last Sunday in an accident with a tobacco harvester at
                Berlo's Best Farm in Norfolk County, two hours southwest of Toronto.</p>
            <p>The province has confirmed his death. The Van Berlo family, who runs Berlo's Best, said they were
                devastated by Yapp's death, adding <quote class="inline-quote">"they did not lose an employee, but they
                    lost a person they
                    considered a member of their family,"</quote> the family's lawyer Bernard Cummins told CBC Toronto.

            <p>In a statement on Tuesday, the Jamaican Ministry of Labour expressed "deep sadness" and said Jamaican
                Labour Minister Karl Samuda will be visiting and touring farms in Canada employing Jamaican workers
                under the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP) this week.</p>
            <p>The Canadian government, meanwhile, said in a statement it "expresses its deepest condolences" to Yapp's
                family, friends and co-workers, and added that the investigation into the death is a provincial matter.
            </p>
            <p>In its own statement, the Ontario Ministry of Labour, whom it falls on to investigate the matter, said
                the investigation is ongoing.</p>
            <p>According to Migrant Workers Alliance for Change (MWAC), three other workers have died in Ontario in the
                last week alone. The workers who penned the open letter are members of MWAC.
            </p>
            <p>
                CBC News has not independently confirmed those three deaths.

                The letter was sent to the Jamaican Observer, where excerpts of it were published on Monday. The workers
                said they sent the letter to Samuda on Aug. 11.

            </p>
            <p>
                Workers wrote they were scared of sharing their grievances with Samuda directly for fear of being kicked
                out of the SAWP. They also said that workers from Mexico and the Philippines share the same grievances.
            </p>
            <p>
                Workers described housing conditions as so poor that rats eat their food. They live in crowded rooms
                with zero privacy with cameras, and lack dryers to dry their clothes after it rains, they wrote.

                On working conditions, workers wrote they're <quote class="inline-quote">"treated like mules"</quote>
                and punished for not being quick enough. They said they're exposed to dangerous pesticides without
                adequate protection, and their bosses are verbally abusive.

            <h2>Ministry calls allegations 'disturbing, inhumane'</h2>

                CBC News reached out to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), which oversees the Seasonal
                Agricultural Worker Program, for comment on the letter.

                A spokesperson for Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion Carla

                Santiago Escobar, the national representative for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, says
                this is a countrywide problem. The union has requested the federal government to make union
                representation a condition of the temporary foreign worker permits, as a result.

                It also asks the provincial government to include agricultural workers in their labour laws and offer

                He says workers fear asserting their rights will lead to homelessness, loss of employment, and
                deportation. As it stands now, workers' permits are tied to their employer, Hussan said.

            <p>
                Hussan says labour laws would help, but farm workers would be unable to assert their rights under those
                laws without full and permanent immigration status.
