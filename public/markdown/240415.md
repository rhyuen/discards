# First Markdown File

Some words may or may not go here.

This is an attempt at using Markdown with HTML/CSS/Javascript.

I am using [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked?tab=readme-ov-file).

For santization, I am using [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify).  I cut and pasted the compiled .min.js file and put it in a shared clientside folder.  It's not pretty.

I couldn't get script tags working in the Markdown file though.

It also seems that you don't need special markdown syntax to use HTML in Markdown.


<h1>
Heading 1
<script type="text/javascript">
    console.log("hi from markdwon");
</script>
</h1>
<h2>
Heading 2</h2>
<p>Paragraph Text.
</p>
