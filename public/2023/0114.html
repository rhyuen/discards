                    The pristine extraterrestrial pebbles contain globules of ferric iron (Fe3+), a version of iron that
                    contains oxygen, which was previously assumed to be rare on the Moon because the lunar surface is
                    chemically
                    “reductive,” meaning that it is not easy for oxidized compounds to form.

                    demonstrate that this compound can be forged by tiny rocks, called micrometeorites, that constantly
                    pelt the lunar terrain. The discovery reveals “a dominant pathway” for the formation of Fe3+ on the
                    lunar surface, and “suggests that much more [ferric iron] could be present on the Moon than
                    previously thought, and that its abundance is progressively increasing with micrometeoroid impacts,”
                    according to a study published on Monday in Nature Astronomy.

                    space, or from lunar ice deposits. However, these explanations don’t fully account for new findings
