                    <h2>Hotter summers to fuel increase in skin cancers, doctors warn
                    </h2>
                    <p class="subtitle">Higher summer temperatures caused by climate crisis will lead to more cases of
                        melanoma, say
                        medics
                    </p>
                    <p>Experts have said higher summer temperatures caused by the climate crisis will fuel an increase
                        in cases of potentially deadly skin cancers such as melanoma. </p>
                    <p>The UK recorded its highest ever temperature of 40.2C last month, as climate scientists stressed
                        the heatwave was not a one-off and high temperatures were likely to become more frequent. </p>
                    <p>Now medics are warning that the changing climate will cast a long shadow should people spend more
                        time in the sun and have greater exposure to UV radiation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “As a clinician treating patients with melanoma, I am definitely concerned that a sustained
                        trend in hotter summers will lead to more cases of melanoma and more deaths from melanoma,” said
                        Sarah Danson, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Julia Newton-Bishop, a clinician scientist leading the melanoma research group at the University
                        of Leeds, said: “Melanoma is caused essentially by sunburn, and this weather is so extreme that
                        I am concerned that sunburns will increase and later so will the incidence of melanoma.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to data from Cancer Research UK, skin cancer death rates among men in the UK have more
                        than tripled since the 1970s, with increases also recorded among women. It is thought the rise
                        may be down to a number of factors including greater sun exposure due to package holidays, with
                        Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, warning that getting sunburn just
                        once every two years can triple the risk of skin cancer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prof Dann Mitchell, an expert in climate science at the University of Bristol, noted that the
                        relationship between warmer weather and health could be indirect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “One of the clearest signals of climate change is hotter temperatures, not just in summer, but
                        all year around,” he said. “This shift in temperatures also shifts behavioural patterns, and
                        people in the UK tend to go outside more when the temperatures are warm. This leads to more
                        exposure to sunlight throughout the year, and crucially more exposure to the UV part of that
                        sunlight, which is a known risk factor for skin cancer.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mitchell added that long-term health consequences of the climate crisis were not discussed
                        enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “This is because we cannot say a specific heatwave caused a specific cancer. Rather, we link the
                        increased risk of cancer to the integration of many warmer days, with these warmer days made
                        more likely due to human-induced climate change,” he said, adding that more research in the area
                        was needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Karis Betts, a senior health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said it was too early to
                        know the impact of the recent heatwaves on skin cancer cases as cancer usually takes many years
                        to develop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But she added: “It’s important to remember that it’s the ultraviolet rays from the sun rather
                        than its heat that cause sunburn and skin cancer. The sun can be strong enough to burn from
                        mid-March to mid-October here in the UK, whether it’s a heatwave or not.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Danson said there were a number of steps that could be take to reduce sun exposure and avoid
                        getting sunburn, including staying out of the sun completely from 11am to 3pm, sitting in the
                        shade, covering up with shirts and hats, and wearing and reapplying sunscreen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Anyone with concerns about a new or changing mole should seek advice from their GP immediately
                        as early diagnosis is really important and we have treatments available,” she said.

                            <p>When Megan Ansems received an email this spring from Nova Scotia's Department of
                                Education and Early Childhood Development containing her teacher licence number, you
                                might say she was excited.

                            <p>Ansems, who graduated this spring from Halifax's Mount Saint Vincent University with a
                                Bachelor of Education, got a jump start on her career when Nova Scotia gave early
                                certification to nearly 300 teacher-candidates just shy of graduation, so they could
                                fill in as substitute teachers during another wave of COVID-19.

                            <p>A shortage of teachers as well as certified substitutes to fill in for them emerged as a
                                major disruption to Canadian classrooms in past waves of the pandemic, and is also
                                expected to continue this fall. But there's a fresh cohort of new educators — like
                                Ansems — eager to fill the gaps this coming school year, especially after many saw
                                first-hand the last few years how much they're needed.

                            <p>In order to do good work that you can be proud of, you need marketable skills, which this
                                book calls 'career capital'. One must use deliberate practice to become the best one can
                                be. Doing the same thing with little variation isn't good enough. One needs to be doing
                                strenuous mental activitiy. It's like working out for your brain/skills instead of your
                                physical body.
